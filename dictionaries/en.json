      {
        "question": "Why does tadm Brain contain both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids?",
        "answer": "Not all omega-6 fatty acids are the same. While conventional Western diets often contain an unbalanced ratio of omega-6 to omega-3, tadm Brain exclusively uses high-quality, inflammation-regulating omega-6, mostly from black cumin oil. Why is this important? \n- Black cumin oil contains thymoquinone, which has proven anti-inflammatory properties and supports the immune system. \n- Omega-6 fatty acids from natural sources like black cumin oil and hemp oil play an important role in cell regeneration and hormone production, without the negative effects of refined omega-6 from industrially processed foods. \n- The carefully balanced ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 in tadm Brain promotes a healthy balance in the body by specifically regulating inflammation rather than promoting it. \nWith tadm Brain, you're only consuming high-quality omega-6 that specifically supports your body – without the risk of an unbalanced fatty acid ratio."
